**Changes Made:**

1.  **`AffectiveAIProcessor.recv`:**
    * Added a `DEBUG_MODE = True` flag.
    * When `DEBUG_MODE` is `True`, the `recv` method now calls `process_video_simplified` instead of `process_video_full`.
    * Audio processing is also commented out in `recv` during debug mode.
    * Added a top-level `try...except` block within `recv` to catch and print any errors that might occur during processing, which could help diagnose issues.
2.  **`process_video_simplified`:** A new method that just gets the frame, adds a timestamp overlay (so you can see it's processing *something*), and returns it. No MediaPipe calls.
3.  **`process_video_full`:** Renamed the original video processing logic to this, so it's easy to switch back.
4.  **Metrics Display:** The section that calculates and displays metrics is now conditionally skipped when `DEBUG_MODE` would be active (since no metrics are being calculated). A placeholder message is shown instead.

**How to Test:**

1.  Run this updated `app.py` with `streamlit run app.py`.
2.  Enter some text in the campaign description box.
3.  Click "Start Analysis".

**Expected Outcome:**

* The webcam should start.
* You should see the raw video feed from your webcam with a timestamp overlay updating in the top-left corner.
* The metrics display area will show the "Running in simplified mode..." message.
* **Crucially:** The video stream should remain active and not turn off immediately.

**Next Steps:**

* **If the stream is now stable:** This strongly indicates that the MediaPipe/audio processing was either too slow for your environment or contained an error. You can now:
    * Set `DEBUG_MODE = False` in `AffectiveAIProcessor.recv`.
    * Re-run the app.
    * If it fails again, look carefully at the Streamlit logs/terminal for errors printed by the new `try...except` block in `recv`. The error message should pinpoint the problem in the analysis functions. You might need to optimize the analysis (e.g., don't refine landmarks if not needed, reduce processing frequency) or ensure your deployment environment (like Hugging Face Spaces) has sufficient resources.
* **If the stream *still* fails (loads and turns off):** The problem is likely not the Python processing code itself, but rather:
    * WebRTC connection issues (STUN/network problems).
    * Browser permissions or conflicts.
    * Fundamental issues with `streamlit-webrtc` in your specific environment (less likely but possible). Check the browser's developer console (F12) for erro
