# Core Streamlit framework
streamlit

# Real-time webcam/mic component for Streamlit
streamlit-webrtc

# Python bindings for FFmpeg (dependency for streamlit-webrtc)
av

# Core Computer Vision & Image Handling
opencv-python-headless # Use headless for server environments

# Real-time Facial and Iris Tracking
mediapipe

# Audio Feature Extraction
librosa

# Numerical Processing
numpy

# Data Handling and CSV Output
pandas

# Note: Sounddevice might not be needed if streamlit-webrtc handles audio capture.
# Using opencv-python-headless is often better for deployment environments
# like Hugging Face Spaces as it avoids potential display server issues.
# Ensure FFmpeg library is available in the deployment environment if `av` requires it.
